## 🎯 Introduction
GEN AI Based data profiling: it will automate customer dataset by processing using LLM model using panda, numpy and other libs which upon spread using couple of training set and along with modeling.
This architecture is flexible and can be adjusted based on the dataset size and complexity.

## 💡 Inspiration
We want to come with the data profiling solution which should be scalable, automated decision making. Sometime building a machine learning model for this kind of dataset which is extracted from real world application where financial and transactional data is used to as risk , fraud detaction regulatory compliance, business decision making, credit scoring and early warning systems. 

## ⚙️ What It Does
It will build a machine learning model that can predict the risk_score for customer on thier financial and transactional data. This can help business make informed decision, such as identifying high risk customer or optimizing financial services.

## 🛠️ How We Built It
This model is built by following ways.
 1. Preproccessing the data set.
 2. Engineering features to improve predictive abilities 
 3. Spiliting the data by providing training and testing sets.
 4. Training and building a smart neural network ehich can predict risk_score.
 5. Finally by evaluating the model perfomance and saving it for deployment.
 

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
Building the machine learning or LLM model for the provided data set can involve serveral challenges.
Below are the few challenges we faced while developing this.

1. Data quality issue : Identifying missing or incosistant data and on top of it incorrect data as an example null values, unformated data for account_balance, currency and transaction_amount.
Remediation : We handle missing values using modeling techniques like mean, medium etc. Also we have clean and validate the data for consitence.
